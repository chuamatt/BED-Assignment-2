# Information

There may be unintended bugs, you're welcome to open a PR and fix it, or if you're too lazy to open a PR, just ignore it.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## Setup

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies required for both the `backend` and `frontend` projects.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the script `setup.sql` either inside MySQL Workbench, or in your CLI. Specific steps may differ based on your operating system.

## Usage

Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run the script `server.js` for both the `backend` and `frontend` projects.

```bash
node server.js
```

Then, using the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) GUI, you can test the API directly.

Alternatively, you can access the frontend website [here](http://localhost:3001). Internet access is required when accessing the website, to load cdn resources.

Detailed information about the API endpoints can be found in the API documentation (`documentation.docx`).
